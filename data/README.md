# Data Directory

This folder stores runtime data generated by the app.

## Structure

- `users.json`: account records (email, password hash, verification state)
- `memories/*.json`: per-user chat memory files

`memories` filenames are generated from `base64url(email)`.

## Important

- This directory is application state, not source code.
- Never store real production secrets in these files.
- If you ship this template publicly, keep only sample/empty data.

## Lifecycle

- Files are auto-created by `app/store.js` during app startup and user activity.
- Deleting files resets local state for users.
